      Developers pay
      <a href=https://artlessdevices.com>Artless Devices</a>,
      the company behind License Zero, commission on each sale.

      Commission is currently ${process.env.COMMISSION}% of
      purchase price for new accounts.

      See the <a href=/terms/agency#commission>commission
      section of the agency terms</a> for specifics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developers also pay <a href=https://stripe.com>Stripe</a>
      for payment processing.  As of May 2020, Stripe offers
      2.9% plus 30&cent; for new accounts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the jurisdictions of the buyer and the
      seller, one or both may owe sales taxes. License Zero
      canâ€™t do your taxes for you, but it reports <a
      href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2>standard
      jurisdiction codes</a> for buyers and sellers, so
      everyone has the records they need to comply.
